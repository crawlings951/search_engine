Search Engine
=============


This was a project I worked on individually which implemented data structures such as Maps and Stacks and mimicked the nature of 
a search engine.

I worked with a partner on the last part which was the creation of a user base with login features.

Name: Carter Rawlings

To compile and run crawler: make -f mk_crawler ./bin/crawler SEEDFILE OUTPUTFILE

To compile and run application: qmake make ./bin/team_project_122 INDEXFILE ADSFILE OUTPUTFILE

Do NOT run qmake -project; we have customized our .pro file.

Part 2 is users - after starting the search engine, (multiple) users can be created, each of whom has a history. Any pages visited from the search menu are recorded and given a weighting for future searches.
